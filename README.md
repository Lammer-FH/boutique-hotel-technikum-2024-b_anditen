# FHTW Botique Hotel App

## Description

The FHTW Boutique Hotel App is a full-stack web application built with Vue.js on the frontend and Spring Boot on the backend. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing hotel reservations, room availability, and guest information.

The frontend of the application is developed using Vue.js, a popular JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It allows for the creation of dynamic and responsive components, making the app interactive and visually appealing.

On the backend, the application utilizes Spring Boot, a powerful Java framework for building enterprise-level applications. Spring Boot provides a robust and scalable foundation for handling business logic, data persistence, and API integrations.

The combination of Vue.js and Spring Boot enables seamless communication between the frontend and backend, ensuring efficient data flow and real-time updates. The app leverages RESTful APIs to retrieve and update data from the backend, providing a smooth user experience.
